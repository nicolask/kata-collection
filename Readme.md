Kata Collection
===============

This project is just a collection of katas for php programmers.
To play with it, just clone the repository and start implementing
the missing things, so that all tests succeed.

The katas don't solve complex problems, but can be seen as simple
riddles. If you solved one, you always should have a second or third
look to it and try to refactor it.

Usage
-----

    $ git clone https://github.com/nicolask/kata-collection
    $ cd kata-collection
    $ composer install
    
run tests

    $ ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests
